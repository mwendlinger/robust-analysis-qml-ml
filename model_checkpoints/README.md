# Usage of the model checkpoints

In the notebooks in the main directory, there is a section on loading pretrained models where you can choose one of the models listed here. The naming convention is as follows:

**\<Model type\> - \<Encoding type\> - \<qubits\> - \<layers\> - \<regularization strength\> - ep\<epoch\>**

e.g. for a re-upload encoding model with 8 qubits, 32 layers and a regularization strength of 0.1, this leads to the file `QVC-ReUp-8-32-0_1-ep20`
