# Code for [A Comparative Analysis of Adversarial Robustness for Quantum and Classical Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16154)
**Maximilian Wendlinger, Kilian Tscharke and Pascal Debus**

This repository contains the code for the experiments for the paper "*A Comparative Analysis of Adversarial Robustness for Quantum and Classical Machine Learning Models*" (2024) by Maximilian Wendlinger, Kilian Tscharke and Pascal Debus presented at [IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE24)](https://qce.quantum.ieee.org).

The code contains the presented dataset, pretrained quantum models, training and attack algorithms as well as lipschitz regularization strategies.
All parts of the code are written in Python using [Pennylane](https://pennylane.ai/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). For visualization we use [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). We have also written a Pennylane Demo on Adversarial attacks for Quantum Machine Learning models based on the presented paper.
